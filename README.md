# pkmnHelper
This is a personal project. No profit intentions of any kind.
The purpose for this project is just to practice some skills such as scraping a webpage using python, and developing a webpage using node.js

The project is about the main pkmn game, to help me build teams for the different tournaments.

Feel free to fork it and push changes
